The [issues](https://github.com/Hxncusik/plugin-configurer/issues) section is an issue tracker for all the kind of problems covered in issue templates. When opening an issue, provide as much information as possible. The difference between a bug getting fixed in 1 week vs 1 hour is in quality of the report. Bug reports where steps to reproduce are "idk" have no value and will not help to get the bug fixed at all.
